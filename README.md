⚡ PowerSentry – Smart Charging Socket

“Automatically cuts power when charging is complete – Save energy. Protect your battery.”

PowerSentry is an IoT-based smart socket that eliminates overcharging by intelligently detecting when a device is fully charged and cutting off the power supply.
Using NodeMCU ESP8266, a relay module, and optional current sensors (ACS712/INA219), it ensures safer, more efficient charging while saving energy and extending battery life.

🔧 Core Features:

Real-time current monitoring to detect full charge

Automatic power cutoff via relay

Optional push notifications via Blynk or Firebase

Easy to prototype, scalable for real-world use

🌍 Impact:

Reduces phantom power draw

Prevents battery degradation

Promotes sustainable energy habits

Safe charging for home, hostel, and elderly users
