⚡ **PowerSentry – Smart Charging Socket**
**“Automatically cuts power when charging is complete – Save energy. Protect your battery.”**

**PowerSentry** is a smart IoT-based socket that prevents overcharging by cutting off the power supply once a device reaches full charge. Built using **NodeMCU ESP8266**, **Arduino Uno**, and a **relay module**, it ensures safe, efficient, and energy-conscious charging. It can simulate charging behavior or integrate actual current sensors for real-time monitoring, all controllable via the **Blynk** app.


🔧 **Core Features**

* Manual ON/OFF control via Blynk 
* Simulated charging progress with percentage tracking 
* Automatic relay cutoff at 100% charge
* Green and Red status indicators 
* Real-time label updates 
* Optional current sensor integration (ACS712 / INA219)



🌍 **Impact**

* Reduces phantom power usage
* Prevents battery overcharging and degradation
* Encourages sustainable and safe charging habits
* Ideal for homes, hostels, and elderly-friendly automation



🛠 **Tech Stack**

* **Microcontrollers**: NodeMCU ESP8266, Arduino Uno
* **Relay Control**: 5V Relay Module
* **Communication**: UART Serial
* **Interface**: Blynk IoT Dashboard
* **Optional Sensors**: ACS712 or INA219 (for real-time current detection)
* **Development Platform**: Arduino IDE, Fritzing (for circuit design)
